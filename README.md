# DSA-Maximum-Difference-Between-Node-and-Ancestor
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.

A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.
```
Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
```
```
class Solution:
    def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0

        def helper(node, cur_max, cur_min):
            # if encounter leaves, return the max-min along the path
            if not node:
                return cur_max - cur_min
            # else, update max and min
            # and return the max of left and right subtrees
            cur_max = max(cur_max, node.val)
            cur_min = min(cur_min, node.val)
            left = helper(node.left, cur_max, cur_min)
            right = helper(node.right, cur_max, cur_min)
            return max(left, right)

        return helper(root, root.val, root.val)
    #Time complexity: O(N)\mathcal{O}(N)O(N) since we visit all nodes once.
    #Space complexity: O(N)\mathcal{O}(N)O(N) since we need stacks to do recursion, and the maximum depth of the recursion is the height of the tree, which is O(N)\mathcal{O}(N)O(N) in the worst case and O(log‚Å°(N))\mathcal{O}(\log(N))O(log(N)) in the best case.
